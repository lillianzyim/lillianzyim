            Using the power of the flower, the Frost Witch lets Cotton and Sherbet say their final goodbyes.

            Sherbet explains that he felt the snow inside his heart from the very beginning and always dreamed of becoming a tiny snowflake. He followed the voice in the snow and was sorry for leaving without saying goodbye. Just like how the warm light from Cotton's lantern always lit his path, he wanted her to remember him whenever she saw snowflakes falling.
